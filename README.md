The Software Vulnerability Checker is a tool that allows users to efficiently retrieve critical information about Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) specifics and their corresponding Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) tailored to specified software versions. This project seamlessly integrates with both the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and a local SQLite database, underscoring its potential to elevate cybersecurity practices.

## Features

- Dynamic input form generation for user-specified software versions.
- Real-time retrieval of CPE identifiers and associated CVEs.
- Modular design for easy integration with other databases or future enhancements.
- User-friendly interface for enhanced accessibility.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
